            The first time I tried coding, I was in highschool. It was cool, I
            liked the fact that I could make my PC do certain things. I never
            really persued it as a hobby, up until college where I had web
            design for a semester. After that I enrolled in a web design class
            at Edunova. It was fun and I loved it, that's where I learned HTML
            and CSS. Because of some unfortunate events, we only scraped the
            surface with JS. After that life happened, I worked on some minor
            translation projects as a freelancer, I also worked in some schools
            and my coding life fell into the second plan. After a year or two of
            being absent, I returned to my real passion and now I'm learning to
            code, at home. And I love it!
